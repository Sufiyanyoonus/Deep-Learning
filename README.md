.Introduction
#The goal of this project is to:

#Utilize the diabetes dataset to build a robust ANN model.
Predict diabetes progression.
Include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and improvements.
Dataset
Source: Scikit-learn
Features: 10 health-related metrics (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure).
Target: Continuous variable representing diabetes progression.
Requirements
#To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

.numpy
.pandas
.scikit-learn
.tensorflow or keras
.matplotlib
.Installation.
#You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of:

#Input Layer: Corresponding to the number of features in the dataset.
Hidden Layers:
Layer 1: 100 neurons with ReLU activation.
Layer 2: 50 neurons with ReLU activation.
Layer 3: 25 neurons with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 1 neuron with a linear activation function.
#Additional Features
Batch Normalization: Improves model stability.
Dropout: Prevents overfitting.
Example Code
python
Copy code
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(25, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Output layer
Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:

#Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squares of the errors.
R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
Improvements Made
Initial Performance
MSE: [Initial MSE value]
R² Score: -3
Changes Implemented
Data Preprocessing: Normalized features and handled missing values and outliers.
Model Architecture Adjustments: Added Batch Normalization and Dropout layers.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Reduced learning rate and implemented early stopping.
Final Performance After Improvements
MSE: [Final MSE value]
R² Score: [Final R² score]
Usage
#To run the model, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python diabetes_ann_model.py
Ensure the dataset is accessible and properly formatted before running the script.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the process of building, evaluating, and improving an ANN model for predicting diabetes progression. The systematic approach taken to refine the model led to significant improvements in performance metrics.
